		<h1>Where I Caught the travel bug!</h1>

			<p>

			Europe! Europe is where I first caught the true travel bug. I had always had an interest in the world,<br>
			but when I took the first trip to Europe to the great city of Berlin, To see my roots in Poland, <br>
			and to the stunning city of Prauge in the Czech Republic I was absolutley hooked!

		<h4>You Should Go!</h4>


	<p>Berlin is a city that I would highly reccomend to anyone and is a great starter destination for an easy for trip abroad! It is my second favorite city in the world. <br> 
		Poland was truly spectacular and I especially liked seeing my family roots and history there. <br> 

		Prauge was a treat in itself and it's the most beautful place I have ever seen. It's a must when in west or central Europe. <br> <br>

Attached below, I have attached a very insightful video from Expedia who do a great job highlighting all of the must sees of Berlin.</p>
