	<h2>About Me:</h2>

	<p> Hi, my name is Connor. I love to travel, to meet new people, try new and delicous foods, and have wacky travel adventures. <br>
		Travel is my absoulte passion, and I think that many people are offset by it's cost, and are too scared to pull the plug. I hope to help change that.<br> 
		On this page, I will show you some of my favorite travel destinations, give you some info on traveling, and give you a breakdown on some of the costs of traveling. <p>

		<h2>Solo Travel:</h2>

			<p> One of the biggest things that I am a proponent of is solo traveling. Solo travel is an entierely different expierence than traveling with a group and can be incredibly rewarding. <br> <br>

				Solo Traveling can be successful in improving your trip and experience by...
				<ol>
					<li>Pushing you out of your comfort zone</li>
					<li>Giving you the freedom to do exactly what you want when you want.</li>
					<li>Making you motivated to go out and meet new people</li>
					<li>Pushing you off the deep end and really enriching the cultural expierence</li>
					<li>And Much More!</li>



				</ol>
