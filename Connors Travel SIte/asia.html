		<h1>The Great Continent of Asia!</h1> <br> 

		<h3>Japan:</h3>


 <p>

			This is the place that keeps bringing me back again and again. <br>
			Japan is where I fell in love with this great continent and I <br>
			am already planning on going back for a 3rd time in less than a 2 year <br>
			span.It's a completely wacky place to visit with the best food in the world, <br>
			in my opinion. Tokyo is my favorite city in the world by far I promise <br>
			you won't get bored. The Country is incredibly safe and a great entry 
			into Asia for a beginner despite the language barrier. <br> 

		This video will help you prepare for your trip! <br>

		<h3>Thailand:</h3>

		<p>
			Thailand, an entirely diffrent beast than Japan and a must see it it's own right. One of the coolest, <br>
			craziest, most culturaly enriching places I have ever been, a must see for any traveler and a great <br>
			entry into SE Asia. WIth the best street food in the world and insanley cheap prices, it's truly <br>
			a must see!
