	<h2>What is the true cost of international travel?</h2>

	<p>
		How much does this all cost you may ask? Well the answer is, it really all depends!<br>
		What it comes down to in the end is your travel style. Do you like to live large and stay <br>
		at the nicest hotels? Or are you ok with staying in dorm style hostels? <br>
		Are you ok with eating street food? Or do you want fine dining every night?<br>
		Everyone has their own travel style. Below are two example to get a rough idea <br>
		comparing both a budget and a more mid-range trip.
